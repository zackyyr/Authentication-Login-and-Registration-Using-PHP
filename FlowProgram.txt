Overall Flow of the System:
1. User navigates to Login/Registration page.
    The system checks if the user is already logged in by checking the session.
    If logged in, redirect to dashboard.php.

2. User submits login credentials (username and password):
    The system hashes the password and checks the database for a matching user.
    If a user is found:
        Log the user in and redirect to the dashboard.
    If no user is found:
        Show a failure message.
 
3. User submits registration details:
    The system checks if the username already exists.
    
    If the username is available:
        Create the new account and show a success message.
    If the username already exists:
        Show a "username already exists" message.

4. User clicks "Logout":
    The system clears the session and destroys the login state, redirecting the user back to the homepage.
